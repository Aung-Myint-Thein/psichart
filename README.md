PSI Chart
========

This is just a very quick implementation of the google bar chart using the 3 hr average of PSI reading data from National Environment Agency.

Currently, the bar chart is very simple and has only one color. More features will come soon. Developers are welcomed to provide suggestions and feedback.

Thank you so much!
